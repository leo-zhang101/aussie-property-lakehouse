# Real-Time Fintech Fraud Detection Streaming Pipeline

An end-to-end real-time data engineering project that simulates payment transactions, streams them through Kafka, processes them using Spark Structured Streaming, and stores results in PostgreSQL for fraud analytics.

This project demonstrates how modern data platforms process **high-volume financial transactions in real time** and detect suspicious activities using rule-based fraud detection.

---

## Project Goal

The objective of this project is to build an advanced streaming data platform that demonstrates:

- real-time transaction event generation
- Kafka-based event ingestion
- Spark Structured Streaming transformation
- data quality validation
- PostgreSQL warehouse loading
- SQL-based analytics on streaming data
# Real-Time Fintech Fraud Streaming Pipeline

## Fraud Detection Logic

Fraud classification is implemented using rule-based logic inside the Spark Structured Streaming job.

Rules include:

- HIGH_RISK → risk_score > 0.8
- HIGH_AMOUNT → transaction amount > 4000 AUD
- INTERNATIONAL → transaction marked as international
- NORMAL → all other transactions

This simulates a simplified real-world fraud detection engine used by fintech companies.

## Example Fraud Analytics Queries

### Fraud Rate by State

```sql
SELECT
    state,
    COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN fraud_flag <> 'NORMAL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fraud_transactions,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN fraud_flag <> 'NORMAL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / COUNT(*),
        4
    ) AS fraud_rate
FROM fact_transactions
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY fraud_rate DESC;
###International vs Domestic Fraud
SELECT
    is_international,
    COUNT(*) AS total_transactions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN fraud_flag <> 'NORMAL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fraud_transactions,
    ROUND(
        SUM(CASE WHEN fraud_flag <> 'NORMAL' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / COUNT(*),
        4
    ) AS fraud_rate
FROM fact_transactions
GROUP BY is_international;
